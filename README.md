Certainly! Here's an alternative approach using a different method for background removal:

python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
image = cv2.imread('download.png')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply adaptive thresholding
thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 2)

# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Create a mask for the signature region
mask = np.zeros_like(thresh)
cv2.drawContours(mask, contours, -1, 255, thickness=cv2.FILLED)

# Bitwise AND to extract the signature
result = cv2.bitwise_and(image, image, mask=mask)
result[mask == 0] = [255, 255, 255]

# Display images
cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
cv2.imshow('Adaptive Threshold', thresh)
cv2.imshow('Result', result)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
This alternative method uses adaptive thresholding to segment the image into foreground (signature) and background. The key differences include:

Adaptive Thresholding:

Instead of Gaussian blur and basic thresholding, we use cv2.adaptiveThreshold with a Gaussian mean to adaptively threshold the grayscale image.
Contours and Mask Creation:

Contours are found in the thresholded image, and a mask is created by drawing these contours filled with white.
Bitwise AND Operation:

The result is obtained by applying a bitwise AND operation between the original image and the mask, followed by setting non-masked areas to white.
